Hello,
Thank you for buying my product. Here I will quickly explain it.

CREATORS:

The original character designs, meshes and the base textures were created by a freelancer artist, Viviene Herzog (lliriel@hotmail.fr). Rigging, implementing to Unity, animations were done by me, Gergely Zsolnay (kalamona01@gmail.com). 
- For this particular products' support, animations, etc.  write to me. 
- If you want to purchase more models from these zombies' designer, or just tell her how great her art is, then write to Viviane.

RIGHTS:

After purchasing there is no additional fee or hidden cost. You can use these models in your commercial game or application as you wish. You can modify them, use them in multiple apps, etc. 

The only thing that you are NOT allowed to do is to re-sell the models as models (for example sightly changing them, then re-uploading them to the Asset Store).

It is a recurring question, so thats why I decided to add it to this readme.

PRODUCT:

The main point of this product is the zombie models. While I prepared a scene so they come towards the camera and can be shot, it is for showcasing the zombies only. My programming skills are low, so I used a lot of hacky and shady solutions. Use the scripts at your own risk.

In the "models" folder you find the "raw" fbx files, ready to be used. If you want to use a different texture on them, you have to put it on them manually, or you can use a script for that (for example "GetRandomTexture"). Note that the textures cannot be changed between zombie types (girl can use only girl skins, boy only boy skins).

LEGACY ANIM VS MECHANIM:

I am not really fond of Mechanim, so the example scene uses legacy animation. I prepared the zombies for mechanim animation though (configured), and made a very simple controller that just cycles 3 idle animations.

Mechanim zombies have the _mechanim suffix, and they use the mechanimScene example scene.

Since my zombies have 4 fingers per hand, the middle fingers bones are the missing ones. 

Compared to the automappers solution, I used Spline for the lower spline, Spline1 for the upper spline (instead of the default Neck), and Neck bone to the mechanim neck slot (instead of the default nothing).




Well, I hope you like the product, if you want anything have questions or comments, you can always contact me on
